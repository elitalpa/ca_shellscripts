# # Notes:
# - Process substitution allows a processâ€™s input or output to be referred to using a filename. It has two forms: output <(cmd), and input >(cmd).
# - we can use process substitution (`diff <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)`) instead of:
# ```shell
# sort file1.txt > sorted_file1
# sort file2.txt > sorted_file2
# diff sorted_file1 sorted_file2
# ```
